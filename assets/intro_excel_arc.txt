GIS Anecdotes?

Housekeeping

Final Project Outline: Due Tues (10/28)
●
●
●
●

Finalize an idea / topic
Write an outline of the Introduction, Data, Methods
Find at least 1 dataset you will use in your final project
See Canvas for Structure
○ Intro - what q are you asking? Why important?
○ Data - what data will you use? Primary / secondary?
○ Methods - how will you process / manipulate data to answer Q?

Housekeeping - Project 2 graded
● Nice work all around!
● More interested in logic to arrive at answer than answer itself
● Resubmit and get ½ credit back for points you missed
○ If resubmitting Project Work or Tutorials - MUST include screenshots
of each individual step to get back ½ credit.

Project 2 Review
●

You’re tasked with supporting several city projects. For each task, choose the
best/most appropriate vector geometry type to describe the feature (Point, Line, or
Polygon) and justify your choice in 1-2 sentences.
○ Mapping individual street trees for a maintenance inventory. Points — each
tree is a discrete location; supports field crews and DB joins.
○ Delineating building footprints for calculating rooftop solar potential. Polygons
— roof area & edges matter for area/azimuth calculations.
○ Representing bus routes for network analysis and travel time estimation. Lines
— traversable networks and route topology are linear.
○ Defining school attendance zones for eligibility checks by address. Polygons
— closed areas for point-in-polygon address checks.
○ Locating reported potholes submitted by residents via a mobile app. Points —
single observed locations; easy to buffer/cluster.

Project 2 Review
●

You’re designing an attribute table for a municipal parcels polygon layer. For
each attribute (column), specify the most appropriate data type (Options:
Integer, Float/Double, Text/String, Date/Time, Boolean) and briefly justify your
choice.
○ Parcel_ID (e.g., “003421-7”) Text/String — preserves leading zeros and
mixed characters like hyphens.
○ Owner_ZIP (e.g., “02108”) Text/String — ZIPs are labels; leading zeros
must be preserved.
○ Assessed_Value (in dollars) Integer (or Float/Double if cents needed) —
numeric currency value used in sums.
○ Impervious_Cover_Pct (0–100 with decimals) Float/Double — needs
decimals (e.g., 42.7%).
○ Has_Easement (yes/no) Boolean — yes/no flag.

Within the sprSoil layer, how many unique values are
present in the “SOILNAME” field? Hint: Use the “Statistics by
Categories” tool. [2pts] 19
Within the sprSoil layer, which type of soil (described in the
“SOILNAME” field) occurs in the largest number of
polygons? Hint: Use the “Statistics by Categories” tool. How
many polygon features have this type of soil? [2pts] Santa
Lucia shaly clay loam [1pt], 19 polygons [1pt]
Within the sprLandUse layer, what is the total acreage of
each land use type (given in the “LUtype” field)? Hint: Use the
“Add Geometry Attributes” tool and/or the “Statistics by
Categories” tool. [2pts] See table below

Project 3 Due Tues 11/4 11:59 pm
● Please Submit 1 document - easier to review and give
feedback that way
○ Include all maps, etc in that doc
● Let me know if you need extra time for whatever reason stuff happens!
○ Would rather you take extra time to learn the material
and get something out of it than submit an incomplete
project!

Final Project Draft - Due Tues 11/11
Based on verbal feedback from in-class conversations and written feedback given
on project brainstorm and outline, write a draft of your final project.
●
●
●
●
●

Submit a working draft of your report.
This should include drafts (or detailed outlines) of the “Introduction”, “Background”, “Study
Goals”, “Data”, “Methods”, and "References" Sections, at a minimum.
Include a map of your 'study area', which should depict the key information around your
project:
HIGHLY suggest including preliminary results - including screenshots of data, tables, maps,
etc that you have produced to this point
Include a REFERENCES section where you cite, in alphabetical order, sources of data used
in your project.
○ BE SURE TO INCLUDE IN-TEXT CITATIONS in (Author, year) format in your report,
where appropriate.

Final Project Tips
● Make your project achievable
○ Pick a relatively small area for your analysis
○ Pick a specific problem
■ Good example:
● How has land use changed in SLO county over the last 15 years
■ Bad example
● How has climate changed in the USA since 1900
● Find your data ASAP
■ Don’t get to the end of the quarter before realizing the data you
want to use in your project does not exist
■ Include Screenshots of data you will use in QGIS

Final Project Tips
● Think about the time component
○ You can’t analyze every single image ever taken over your study area
○ Select your time window of analysis based on what you’re studying
■ Before / after fires
■ Before / after algal blooms
■ Contrast vegetation dynamics in spring / fall
■ Contrast hydrologic dynamics in drought / flood
● Analyzing the same area across different times can reveal interesting dynamics
in terms of:
○ Seasonality, hydrology, vegetation and fire, ocean dynamics, etc

Final Project Resources
● Remember - you can easily export vector data to excel to make charts, graphs
etc
● High quality examples are on canvas!
● Need help finding or processing data?
○ Digital Projects Lab Peer assistants can help you
○ Book time with them here: https://guides.lib.calpoly.edu/dpl
○ I can help you: OH = M / W 12-1pm
○ Haley can help you
○ ChatGPT can (probably) help you
○ Google can help you
○ Etc…
● Potentially helpful datasets can be found here:

Solving GIS problems - debugging
● If you get an error message: “ERROR: SOMETHING HAPPENED”
○ Try copy / pasting into:
■ Google / ChatGPT
○ Look for resources on:
■ StackExchange / Quora / Reddit / Blogs
● Else, write a description of what you were doing to cause the
problem, or a description of the problem into any of the above.
● Go for a walk - take a 10 min break and reset - or try again with
fresh eyes first thing in the AM!
● Collaborate and work together to solve problems!

Solving GIS problems - Think like computer
● Must *exactly* follow the instructions
○ … in the correct order
○ … with the correct data
○ … etc
● It can be tricky
● If something doesn’t work that *should* work, and you don’t know
why:
○ Remove the layer, try again
○ Restart the program (QGIS), and try again
● You’ll be amazed how much this fixes.
● The computer just does what we tell it to
● Collaborate and work together to solve problems

Solving GIS problems - it’s really about mindset
●
●
●
●
●
●

It takes patience
It takes discipline
It takes resilience
It takes growth mindset
It’s ok to get frustrated
It’s not ok to let challenges stifle your curiosity, motivation, and
appetite to learn

Nothing worth doing is easy - progress comes through struggle and
adversity.

NEW MATERIAL: Geocoding
● Sounds fancy (coding != programming?)
● Refers to translating addresses (e.g. 1234 Grand St. San
Luis Obispo, 93401) to lat/lon coordinates
● Can also “Reverse Geocode”, and transform lat/lon
coordinates to addresses
● Useful in city planning, demographics, social sciences, etc

● Lots of online tools that do this for free

NEW MATERIAL: Arc Pro
● Another type of GIS software by ESRI, Environmental
Systems Research Institute (Redlands CA)
● Same features, but costs several $1000s per year
● Common in Government orgs, large Nonprofits
● Easier / more user friendly than QGIS
● Not open source, only Windows operating system, no
community development (no plugins), less customization,
less helpful material online
