# NR 218 Project 2: Vector Data Analysis


## Learning Goals

- Become familiar with vector processing operations in QGIS, import and create GIS data
- Perform basic joins and spatial operations such as buffer, dissolve, intersect, union
- Style maps in a custom fashion based on columnar values
- Understand different data types and corresponding data representations  
- Query and filter spatial datasets 

## Written Responses

Provide written responses to the following Questions:

1. **Measurement Scales**: The following data are using which type of measurement scale?
   - My happiness score on a scale of 1 to 10 = 7
   - My weight = 192 lbs.
   - The city I live in = Helsinki Finland
   - My current body temperature = 99.8 $\circ$ F
   - My current body temperature = 37.7 ÂºF
   - My current body temperature = 310.8 K
   - The number of impossible burgers I can eat before passing out = 12
   

2. **Digitizing Methods**: Describe at least two different methods for adding the information from a USGS topographic map to a digital GIS.

3. **Accuracy and Precision Errors**: What are the five types of accuracy/precision errors associated with geographic information? Provide an example of each type of error.

4. **Boundary Mapping Challenges**: Per the description of the positional accuracy of wetland boundaries in the textbook, discuss a different map feature whose boundaries are inherently vague and difficult to map.
