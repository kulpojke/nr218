__Task__

Estimate the change in the volume of water ($\Delta V$) that was in the reservoir between summer, 2018 and February, 2024. This can be done using tools that we have already used in this class.

## Solution
In order to calculate the volume of the reservoir we will perform a 1D numerical integration by stacking prismoidal estimates of volume.

## Mosaic DEM 

The DEM is in tiles so you need to mosaic it.  I used `Raster` > `Conversion` > `Polygonize`.  Here we will call the mosaicked DEM, `dem`.


## Find the approximate summer 2018 Water surface 

This can be done using the 208 S2 image, or the DEM.   Here we will use the DEM for this step.  THe method using the Sentinel-2 image would be similar to they way we will fine the area and elavation for th e 2024 sentinel image later int his tutorial.

To do this, first create a hillshade to visualize the DEM (here shown as red relief).The lake surface (as determined by the USGS) is easily visible as a perfectly flat area. Use the information tool ![](img/info_tool.png){style="height: 1.2em"} to find the elevation of the lake surface (214.16 ft, shockingly close to sea level!). Then use the raster calculator and polygonize tool to segment out the lake surface (see @fig-surf2018). Now you can calculate the 2018 lake surface area and  you know the elevation ($z_{2018} = 65.2759659112~\text{m}$).  (Some people may be happy to use this DEM as is and calculate the change in volume in acre-feet, but I would much rather have it in $m^3$, so I converted the DEM values from ft to m (`dem@1 / 3.28084` in raster calculator).  We will call this new DEM `dem_m`.

>Note: For the raster calculator if you use `dem@1 = 214.16` you will probably get an empty raster.  This is due to [floating-point representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_error_mitigation) error.  Instead use something like `dem@1 > 214.15 AND dem@1 < 214.17`

## Find the approximate summer 2024 Water surface 

Next we will find the surface area and elevation of the lake surface in February, 2024.  The process is similar to what that for 2018, but this time you will need to use the S2 image. Use the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to segment the lake surface. Calculate it with the raster calculator.  Results should be similar to @fig-MNDWI_2024.

$$ 
\mathrm{MNDWI} = \frac{green - SWIR}{green + SWIR}
$$

>Note: There are two SWIR bands in S2 imagery.  After trying both I determined SWIR1 was better in this case. This makes sense, because SWIR2 is more sensitive to soil moisture.  Here we only want the water surface.

![MNDWI calculated using SWIR1 from Sentinel-2 median composite imagery for February 2024. ](img/cachuma_MNDWI_2024.png){#fig-MNDWI_2024}

Then create a mask layer (MNDWI > 0) and polygonize (there will be other small polygons of small detached pools in the river above the reservoir, and below the dam.  Extract the polygon of interest.) Now you have the surfaces (or inundation areas) for 2018 and 2024 as shown in @fig-surfs.

![Approxinate extent of water in Lake Cachuma in summer, 2018 and February, 2024. ](img/cachuma_water_surfs.png){#fig-surfs}

If you use the "Add geometry attributes" tool on the two surface areas (you may need to use "Fix geometries" first) then you now have $z_{2018}$, $A_{2018}$, and $A_{2024}$.  Now you need $z_{2024}$.  To get this, create points along the 2024 polygon ("Points along geometry", I used 10m as interval).  Now sample the raster at those points ("Sample raster values").  If you look closely at the map, and as can be seen in @fig-points, you will notice that many of the points actually fall a little inside the 2018 boundary, i.e. on the water surface from 2018.  This is due to registration error (misalignment) and differences in resolution. 

![Some points in the 2024 water boundary fall inside of the 2018 boundary, which is nonsense.](img/points_in_water.png){#fig-points}

One way of reducing the error from this phenomenon is to extract some points from places where the 2024 water boundary runs across relatively flay areas.  In the locations horizontal displacements will only result in small vertical displacements (@fig-flats)

![Extracted points lying in fairly flat areas.](img/cachuma_flatish.png){#fig-flats}

Now use Excel, QGIS plotting tools (which kind of stink), or some other software of your choice to create a histogram of the extracted points elevations (@fig-hist). 

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of extracted points with mean and median."
#| label: fig-hist
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.gcf()
fig.patch.set_alpha(0) 

df = gpd.read_file('untracked_qgis/cachuma/flattish_points.geojson')

mu = round(df.SAMPLE_1.mean(), 2)
m = round(df.SAMPLE_1.median(), 2)

ax = df.SAMPLE_1.hist(bins=20, edgecolor='k', color='hotpink',)
ax.axvline(x=mu, color='lime', linestyle='--', label='Mean');
ax.axvline(x=m, color='darkred', label='Median');
legend = ax.legend();
legend.get_frame().set_alpha(0);
legend.get_frame().set_facecolor('none');
legend.get_frame().set_edgecolor('none');
for text in legend.get_texts():
    text.set_color('whitesmoke');
ax.text(0.77, 0.8, f'Mean = {mu}', transform=ax.transAxes, fontsize=10, color='whitesmoke');
ax.text(0.77, 0.75, f'Median = {m}', transform=ax.transAxes, fontsize=10, color='whitesmoke');
ax.set_facecolor('none');
ax.set_xlabel('Elevation (m)')
```

Since the mean and median values are both $\approx$ 69.2 m, it would appear to be a good value to choose for $z_{2024}$. 


## Calculate the volume of the reservoir

In order to calculate the volume of the reservoir, next we will calculate the volume of slices of the reservoir between $z_{2018}$ and $z_{2024}$  For a given slice,

$$  
V_{n} \approx \Delta z \times \frac{A_{n}+A_{n+1}}{2}
$$ {#eq-slice}

$$ 
\Delta V = \sum_{n=0}^{n} V_{n}
$$ {#eq-total}

where the volume of the slice $V_{n}$ is approximated by the depth of the slice $\Delta z$ times the mean area of the top ($A_{n}+A_{n+1}$) and bottom ($A_{n}+A_{n}$) of the slice, and $\Delta V$ is the sum of all the slices.  @fig-schem shows a schematic representation of the volume approximation method.

![Cross-sectional schematic of volume estimation method described in @eq-slice and @eq-total](img/cachuma_schem.png){#fig-schem}

In order to calculate $V_{n}$ for each slice, starting from the 2018 water level, first pick a value for $\Delta z$, here we will use 1 m. Then find the surface area of the reservoir at $z_{2018} + \Delta z$.  This can be done using the raster calculator to create a mask for pixels lying between the lake surface, and 1 m above the lake surface (`(dem_m@1 > 65.275) AND (dem_m@1 < 66.3)`). You can then polygonize the mask and extract the polygon representing the surface (see @fig-z1).

![Lake surface area with water level 1m higher than in in summer 2018, estimated using the DEM](img/cachuma_zplus1.png){#fig-z1}

Now, for the first slice ($\Delta Z_{0}$) we have estimates for the area of the bottom ($A_{0} \approx 6544034.000155964 \text{m}^{2}$ ) and area of the top ($A_{1} \approx 7512197.9998339815 \text{m}^{2}$), and we know the thickness of the slice is 1 m. Calculating an estimate for the volume of the slice using @eq-slice gives $\approx 2.5 \times 10^{13} m^{3}$




This process is repeated for each 1 m thick slice (the final slice will be thinner as it is limited by $Z_{2024}$). Formulas for calculating the lake surface area at each step are given in @tbl-slices.

Formula for each surface area at the top of each slice, and its corresponding surface area. 
:::

It is important to note that the calculated surface may begin to include areas on the other side of the spillway, and the polygon will need to be split (@fig-split_poly).

![At 2m above the 2018, the surface connects through the spillway to areas outside of the lake.  It needs to be separated by turning on editing and using the _split features_ button.](img/uh_oh_2.gif){#fig-split_poly}

@tbl-volumes shows the thickness and calculated volume of each slice, as well as that of $\Delta V$.  The estimate I ended up with is $\approx 2.43 \times 10^{7} \text{m}^{3})$ (or $1.97 \times 10^{4} \text{acre-feet}$, or 24 GL, or $2.06 \times 10^{-41} \text{ly}^{3}$). For reference, that much water has a mass of about is about $7.14 \times 10^{09}$ that of the largest racoon ever recorded!
