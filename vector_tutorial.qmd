# Vector Operations

## Vector Data (Review)

::: {.r-stack}
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width = "40%"}
::: {style="font-size:0.7em"}
+ Can be described by points, lines, polygons
  + Ex: roads, rivers, train tracks, hiking trails, sidewalks, building footprints, county boundaries
+ NOT images, do NOT contain any pixels

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width = "40%"}
::: {style="font-size:0.7em"}
+ Often stored as tabular data files with geographic metadata
+ Points, lines, and polygons represent the spatial features
+ Topology describes the connectivity, area definition, and contiguity of interrelated points, lines, and polygon

## Buffer

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out data-fragment-index="1"}
![](img/buffer.png)
:::

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out data-fragment-index="2"}
![](img/ripar_buffer.jpg){style="max-height: 50vh;"}
:::

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out data-fragment-index="3"}

1. Open QGIS and open the 'sprStreams.geojson' from the SPR data we used the other day. (If you do not have it any longer it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kulpojke/nr218/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/SPR_data.zip))
2. In the drop down menu go to, Vector --> Geoprocessing tools --> Buffer

![The buffer tool situated within the vector dropdown menu.](img/buffer_dropdown.png){fig-alt="IMage showing the buffer tool situated within the vector dropdown menu." fig-cap="The buffer tool situated within the vector dropdown menu."}

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out data-fragment-index="4"}
[Notice the Units!  Buffering in degrees makes no sense. Reproject it first! What is a good projection to use?]{style="font-size:0.6em"}

## Dissolve

![](img/dissolve.png)

1. In QGIS open  `sprSoil.geojson` 
2. Change symbology to categorical by "SOILNAME"
3. Vector --> Geoprocessing tools --> Dissolve
4. Use "HYDROGRPOUP" as dissolve field


## Clip
1. Vector --> Geoprocessing tools --> Clip
2. Clip the sprSoil by the streams buffer.

## Spatial overlays

::: {.r-stack}

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out .smaller}
1. Intersect soils with bufffer, look at attributes
2. Intersect buffer with soils, look at attributes

![](img/intersect.png)
:::

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out .smaller}
Union

![](img/union.png)
:::

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out .smaller}
Symmetric Difference  

+ Try it with buffer and soils

## Joins

::: {r-stack}

::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out data-fragment-index="1"}
__Tabular joins__ join layers by matching a common column name (e.g., parcel_id or GEOID)

![](img/joins_image0.png){style="max-width: 90%; max-height: 60vh; object-fit: contain;"}
:::


::: {.fragment .absolute .fade-in-then-out data-fragment-index="2"}
Spatial joins transfer attributes based on how features relate in space (intersects, within, nearest)

## Tabular Joins {style="font-size:0.7em"}

1. Download [California Counties](https://github.com/kulpojke/nr218/blob/main/assets/cal_counties.geojson) and [median household income](https://github.com/kulpojke/nr218/blob/main/assets/cal_median_household.csv)

2. add the counties layer

3. add the income csv (you must select "no geometry (attribute only table)")

3. Open the attribute tables for each look at the names for the columns containing county name

4. In the Processing Toolbox search "join" and select "join attributes by field"
    + Input layer 1 is counties, input layer 2 is  
    + use appropriate column names

5. Look at the attribute table of the resulting layer

6. Change the symbology to make a thematic map showing median income by county.

## Spatial Joins {style="font-size:0.7em"}

__One-to-One Spatial Join__

+ Output: Each feature from the target layer (the primary layer) gets a single matching record from the join layer (secondary layer).
+ Handling Multiple Matches: If multiple matches are found, only one matching feature is selected (usually the first or based on criteria like nearest neighbor).
+ Example:Joining cities (target) with climate zones (join layer), ensuring each city gets only one associated climate zone.
__One-to-Many Spatial Join__

+ Output: If multiple matching features exist, the target feature is duplicated for each matching feature from the join layer.
+ Handling Multiple Matches: Every matching record from the join layer is included, leading to multiple rows for one target feature.
+ Example: Joining states (target) with cities (join layer). Each state will appear multiple times for every city within its boundaries.

## Merge vs Spatial Join

__Spatial Join__:  
 You might use a spatial join to combine data from a "census tracts" layer with a "crime incidents" layer to see the crime statistics within each census tract. 

__Merge__:  
You might use a merge to combine two adjacent land parcels into a single, larger parcel with a new boundary.

Download [Cities](https://gis.data.ca.gov/api/download/v1/items/8cd5d2038c5547ba911eea7bec48e28b/geojson?layers=2)


+ Use the "join attributes by location" tool from the geoprocessing toolbox to join cities to counties 
+ There will be problems. Hint: "validate geometries and "fix geometries" tools will be useful.

__Challenge__ - Join counties to cities, and calculate total urban area for each county.
