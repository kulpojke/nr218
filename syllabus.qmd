## Class Details
Building 10 (Erhart Agriculture, a.k.a. part of _Aglish_), Room 204 

Monday: 9:10 - 1:00  
Wednesday: (9:10 - 12:00) 

## Instructor Details
Michael Huggins  
Office Hours: Mondays 2:30 - 4:30  
Building 72-107 (Plant Conservatory)   
    
## Learning Goals
+ How to formulate and answer problems using spatial data  
+ How to create quality maps and graphics
+ Apply skills in remote sensing, GIS, and data science to solve a problem of your own design
+ Understand basic principles of GIS


## Project Assignments

This course centers on a series of 4 projects using different types of GIS data. The projects build on one another and you will learn new skills for each project. Plenty of class time will be spent on project work. Each student should hand in their own projects. Projects are due every other week (see [calendar](#fall-term-calendar-2025) for dates).  Late assignments will be deducted 5% per day late. 

There is also a final project as well as an exam.

For your final project you will propose a novel GIS question and collect or analyze data to answer it.  


## Assignment Weight
| Assignment     | Percentage of Grade| Description  |
|----------------|------|----|
| Project 1      | 10  |  Mapping  |
| Project 2      | 10  |  Vector Data Analysis  |
| Project 3      | 10  |  Raster Data Analysis  |
| Project 4      | 15  |  Remote Sensing, Image Analysis, and Modeling  |
| Final Project  | 25  |  ![See description](final_proj.md)   |
| Exam           | 20  |  Will be hard, but curved  |
| Participation  | 10  |  Will be based on ![exit tickets](#attendance-policy) and engagement  |
| Assignment 0   | 1 (bonus) | Easy bonus points



 
## Grading

A: ≥ 90%  
B: ≥ 80%  
C: ≥ 70%  
D: ≥ 60%  
F: < 60%  

Total 100%  

Note: Grading is not curved (Except exam).


## Assignment Submission Policy 

Assignments (except the final project) will be submitted on Canvas.  Students are allowed a 48-hour ‘no questions’ asked grace period on assignment submissions. You do not need to give any reason as to why your submission is late, as long as it is submitted within 48 hours of the deadline.

## Attendance Policy 

Before leaving for each class you will need to turn in an "exit ticket". The exit ticket is simply a short answer to a question that will given in class. The exit ticket will let me know that you were in class, and help me to gauge how well students are absorbing the material.  You are allowed 3 unexcused absences. Beyond 3 unexcused absences, you will be deducted 2% of the total grade for each unauthorized absence.

## Academic Integrity

All students should be familiar with and adhere to the university’s academic integrity policy, which can be found here: https://osrr.calpoly.edu/academic-integrity 


## Use of AI

AI generated text __may not be used__ for any writing.

Students can seek AI assistance for project work, but it is important to consider that AI will make you stupid and waste your time!
    + Depending on AI prevents development of critical thinking, writing, and problem-solving skills
    + AI will sometimes lead you down a terrible, deep rabbit hole of confusion
    + Getting quick answers without working through problems will leave gaps in foundational knowledge needed for advanced coursework
    + The struggle of working through difficult concepts is often where the most valuable learning occurs

That is not to say LLMs are never useful or appropriate to use, but you need to know their limitations.

 
## Textbook

We will read Essentials of Geographic Information Systems during this course. A free and online version of the textbook can be found [here](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_essentials-of-geographic-information-systems)


 
## Tutorials

We will refer to a number of tutorial videos which describe QGIS processing. These will come primarily from two sources: 

[Ujaval Gandhi's QGIS Tutorials and Tips](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/index.html )


[QGIS Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)


There are many other helpful sources of information on GIS Software
