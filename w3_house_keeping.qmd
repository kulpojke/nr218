## Final Project Brainstorm 

__Due October 15th__

Come up with your own geospatial analysis idea. Submit a well thought out paragraph which describes:

1. The question/problem you have identified
2. The geographic data you will use to answer the question
2. The geoprocessing steps you will perform on the data
2. The expected outputs of your analysis

You may also frame your question as a hypothesis test (as in the Scientific Method)

+ Submit 1 pdf per group.
+ If you are having a hard time coming up with an idea come to me.
