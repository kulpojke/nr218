## Data and directory structure
First we will need the data.  Download the vector file of fire perimeters and 2022 NAIP (see @tip-naip for information about NAIP ) image below. 

+ [fire perimeters](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/IQDiOQnn5iZ2SoC9RFOZXMQ6AYohr1UK1PuzRVCWknsOpLQ?e=iYy6tc)
+ [NAIP image](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/IQC4SX4KSSrKQZEguH7aIaGnATBJndw0cRt9vi8a-KiAw0A?e=xlgu0Q)

[The fire perimeters data is a subset of polygons from California Historical Fire Perimeters dataset from [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/group/fire)]{style="font-size:0.3.5em"}.

## What is NAIP

The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the United States. It is generally made available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.

+ High-resolution aerial imagery of the continental United States
+ Collected during agricultural growing seasons
+ Typically 4-band: Red, Green, Blue, Near-Infrared (NIR)
+ 60 cm (or better) spatial resolution
+ Updated on a 2-3 year cycle for each state


:::


Create a working directory, called `lab_10`, for this lab in you nr218 Folder. Create a `data` folder and put the downloaded data inside.  Also create a `docs` directory in the lab directory. You will store your outputs in `docs`

Open QGIS, start a new project, and save it in the `lab_10` folder as `lab10_your_name.qgz` (use your actual name)

You should then have something like this.

```
lab_10/
├── lab10_your_name.qgz
├── data/
│   ├── subset_of_cal_hist_fires.geojson
│   └── naip_2022.tif
└── docs/
    
```

## Vector Preparation

1. Open the fire perimeters dataset in QGIS.
2. Extract the perimeter of the Coffee Fire (`FIRE_NAME` is `COFFEE`).  There are a few ways you can do this, your choice.  Name the resulting layer `Coffee` (and save a file).
3. Reduce the fire perimeter layer, `subset_of_cal_hist_fires`,  by selecting only fires that have happened since 2014 (Hint: extract by attribute). i.e. `YEAR_ > 2013`. Name the resulting layer `scratch_1`.
4. Now extract all of the polygons which _overlap_ the `Coffee` (Hint: "select by location"). Name the result, `scratch_2`.

5. Use the "Extract layer extent" tool to get a polygon of the extent of the Coffee fire. Name the result `extent`.

![Vectors created while creating `fires_in_AOI`](img/lab_10_vectors.png ){#fig-vectors .wrap-right}

6. Buffer "extent" by 1000 m, use mitered joint style. (try it with default joint style too, what is the difference). name the buffered layer, our area of interest, `AOI`.  @fig-vectors shows the layers that should have been created at this point (AOI is still called `Buffered`).
7. Clip `scratch_2` by the AOI. Save the results as `fires_in_AOI`.
8. When you are satisfied that `fires_in_AOI` turned out correctly you can delete `scratch_1`, `scratch_2', `Coffee`, and `extent`.

9. Open `naip_2022`. Open the Layer Properties dialog . Go to the Transparency tab on the left. Change Transparency Band to None (what is band 4?).
10. Clip `naip_2022 to the AOI.  `Raster` -> `Extraction` -> `Clip Raster By Mask Layer`
11. Name the result `naip_2022_clipped`
12. Now lets view it as False color
    a. Recall from earlier, that is NIR, G, R
    b. Open symbology and change the band order

13. Calculate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    a. $$NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}$$
    b. Open Raster Calculator ( _Raster_ -> _Raster Calculator_)
    c . enter ` ( "naip_2022_clipped@4"  - "naip_2022_clipped@1" )  /  ( "naip_2022_clipped@4" + "naip_2022_clipped@1" )` 
    d. check the "create on the fly raster ..." box at the top under "Result Layer"
    e. Run

    NDVI values

| Value Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | Water, clouds, or non-vegetated surfaces.|
| 0 to 0.1 | Exposed rock, sand, or snow. |
| 0.2 to 0.5 | Sparse vegetation, |
| 0.6 to 0.9 | Dense Vegetation |

$$
SAVI = \frac{(NIR - Red) \times (1 + L)}{NIR + Red + L} 
$$

Where $L$ is often 0.5, but adjusted for exposed soil


1. Open [this link](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/EvajxRo6YZFDgoVwZbQ-SqsBwlztU-GDezW1ptGbEQR29g?e=TXsTmE) (perhaps in a new tab) check the check mark next to all of the files, and click the download button at the top of the page. This should start downloading a zip of the file.

2. Unzip them and put them into a new directory, called `s2`, in your fire_example

3. Do the same for [this other link](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/Eu-EXQBbsGxLgzR5oVFAMrwBhBlRqBtpv-tpS6A79lW5UQ?e=M0YpcM) but put them into `s2_nbr`

4. Download this [DEM](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/EZLMJ_FttfRAu15KmRigEV8ByZOu-YidfyiqnJXpZeMy9A?e=o8VTm2) and put them into the data directory in your fire_example, as seen to the right.

5. Finally, download this [Land use](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/EcppyDdlx-lDggbCMv4zEXMBH_ps-0EcglHWZgZXUz1dsg?e=FQ1REl) raster and save.

5. Using extract selection or extract by attribute, make separate `Coffee` and `River` layers from your `fires in AOI` layer.

6. Spatial Overlays:
    a. Find the difference between the `River` and `Coffee` layers, call it `river only`
    b. Find the difference between the `Coffee` and `River` layers, call it `coffee only`
    c. Find the intersection between the `Coffee` and `River` layers, call it `both`
    d. __Use the AOI and the three layers you just found to make a polygon called `unburned`, i.e neither.__

7. In GeoProcessing Toolbox find "Raster Calculator".
    a. right click it and select "Execute as Batch Process"

8. Make random points inside of `coffee only` `river only` and `both` using the "Random Points Inside Polygons" tool with:
    a. Sampling Strategy = point density
    b. Point Count or Point Density = 0.000001 (this is per m$^{2}$)

9. Install Point Sampling Tool pluggin.
