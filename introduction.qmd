## Active Learning and Growth Mindset {auto-animate=true style="font-size:0.5em"}

+ AI generated text [__may not be used for any writing__]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} .
+ It is ok to seek AI assistance for project work, but it is important to consider that AI has the potential to make you stupid and waste your time!
    + Depending on AI prevents development of critical thinking, writing, and problem-solving skills
    + AI will sometimes lead you down a terrible, deep rabbit hole of confusion
    + Getting quick answers without working through problems will leave gaps in foundational knowledge needed for advanced coursework
    + The struggle of working through difficult concepts is often where the most valuable learning occurs

That is not to say LLMs are never useful or appropriate to use, but you need to know its limitations.

## Class Icebreaker

__Three things in common__

+ Get is small groups  
+ Take 5 minutes to identify three things you have in common with each other
  + Choose intresting things.  The stranger, the better
  + Boring examples:
    + "We are a forest and fire sciences majors"
    + "We are all from Southern California"
