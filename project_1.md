## Learning Goals

- Understand geographic concepts
- Start working with geographic data 
- Make your first map!
- Start working with map attributes and styling

## Written Responses

Provide written responses to the following Questions:

1. **Map Scale Analysis**: Determine and discuss the most appropriate representative fractions for the following verbal map scale descriptions: (a) individual person, (b) neighborhood, (c) urban, (d) regional, (e) national, and (f) global.

2. **Map Projections Research**: Go to the National Atlas website and read about map projections ([archived link](http://web.archive.org/web/20110717124751/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/mapping/a_projections.html)). 

3. **Geographic Terms**: Define the following terms: (a) datum, (b) developable surface, (c) secant, (d) azimuth, (e) rhumb line, and (f) zenithal.

4. **Projection Properties**: Describe the general properties of the following projections: (a) Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), (b) State plane system, and (c) Robinson projection.

5. **USGS Topographic Maps**: 
   - Download a map for your place of residence from: https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/
   - What are the scale, projection, and contour interval of the USGS topographic map that you downloaded for your place of residence?

6. **Coordinate Systems**: Find the latitude and longitude of your hometown. Explain how you can convert the coordinates from DD to DMS or vice versa.

## Project Work

### Setup (Optional)
