- [Calculating Line Lengths and Statistics](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/calculating_line_lengths.html )


# Making a Map (3 pts)

**Make your first (production quality) map!** 
- Make a subdirectory called `map` within your `NR218/project_1` directory in which to store files for this part.
