# NR 218 Project 1: Mapping

## Learning Goals

- Understand geographic concepts
- Start working with geographic data 
- Make your first map!
- Start working with map attributes and styling

## Written Responses (3 pts)

Provide written responses to the following Questions:

1. **Map Scale Analysis**: Determine and discuss the most appropriate (approximate) representative fractions for the following verbal map scale descriptions: (a) individual person, (b) neighborhood, (c) urban, (d) regional, (e) national, and (f) global.

2. **Map Projections Research**: Go to the National Atlas website and read about map projections ([archived link](http://web.archive.org/web/20110717124751/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/mapping/a_projections.html)). Define the following terms:
   a. datum
   b. developable surface
   c. secant
   d. azimuth
   e. rhumb line
   f. zenithal

4. **Projection Properties**: Describe the general properties of the following projections: 
   a. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
   b. State plane system
   c. Robinson projection

5. **USGS Topographic Maps**: 
   - Download a map for your place of residence from: https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/
   - What are the scale, projection, and contour interval of the USGS topographic map that you downloaded for your place of residence?

6. **Coordinate Systems**: Find the latitude and longitude of your hometown. Explain how you can convert the coordinates from DD to DMS or vice versa.


## Tutorial Assignments (3 pts)

1. **Complete the following tutorials** and submit screenshots of the final product:
   - [Working With Attributes](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/working_with_attributes.html)
   - [Basic Vector Styling](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/basic_vector_styling.htm)
   - [Calculating Line Lengths and Statistics](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/calculating_line_lengths.html )


## Project Work (4 pts)

### Setup (Optional)
**[Optional]** Carefully follow the instructions to install QGIS on your personal computer - if you are not comfortable using your own machine, skip this step and use the machines in the classroom. Allow 5-10 mins to download and install, depending on your internet connection: https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/install-qgis-ltr.html


**Make your first (production quality) map!** 
- Look through the  [Making a Map tutorial](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/making_a_map.html)
- Use what you have learned in lecture and the previous tutorials to make you first map
   + Use the `SPR_data.zip` from the files section of Canvas (we already used it in class)
   + Make a map showing either vegetation type, soil type, timber type, or or land use
   + Be sure to include standard elements such as scale and north arrow.  
   + Decisions about what style and elements will best convey the information are up to you
- Submit a PDF image of the final map you created at the end of the tutorial



## Submission Requirements

Submit the following items:

1. **Written Responses**: Answers to Questions 1-6 above

2. **[Optional]** A screenshot showing that you successfully installed QGIS (include the time and date in the screenshot)

3. **First Map**: An image of your first map (.tiff, .jpeg, .png, or .pdf format) created from Tutorial 1
   - Be sure to include all the necessary elements required for a high quality map (i.e. scale bar, north arrow, legend, gridlines, coordinate labels)

4. **Tutorial Screenshots**: Screenshots of the final outputs and processing steps of the (1) Working With Attributes Tutorial, (2) Basic Vector Styling Tutorial, and (3) Calculating Line Lengths and Statistics Tutorial
