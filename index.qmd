## Class Icebreaker


## What is GIS?

:::{.fragment}
Computer-based tools used to store, visualize, analyze, and interpret geographic data
:::

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
  OR  
  Collection of computer hardware, software, data,
personnel, and work procedures to store, update,
manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographic
information.

## Application Domains
GIS is useful is many domains, for example:
+ weather forecasts  
+ navigation  
+ delivery logisitics   
+ apps (e.g. Strava!)   
+ disaster response    
+ infrastructure monitoring   
+ climate monitoring / modeling   
+ urban/regional planning
+ architecture
+ archaeology
+ geography
+ social sciences
+ (geo)physics
+ hydrology
+ biology
+ ecology
+ etc...

## Why use GIS
Monitor and understand our planet

## Software{style="font-size: 0.5em"}
:::{.fragment}
+ This Class will be taught using QGIS (but you can use anything you want)
+ Software changes - We will focus on building an understanding of the concepts that will allow you to successfully use any GIS software.
:::

:::{.r-stack}
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
There are many other common GIS (GUI based) software platforms:  
  - [ESRI (ArcGIS suite)](https://www.geographyrealm.com/qgis-versus-arcgis/)  
  - [GRASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS)  
  - [Google Earth Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth#Google_Earth_Engine)  
  - Google Earth Pro  
  - ENVI  
  - SAGA  
  - etc...  
  ![](img/qgis_screen.png){.absolute top=220 left=500 width="200"}

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
There are also command line tools  
  - [GDAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL)  
  - PDAL  
  - WhiteBox Tools  
</p>

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">
Additionally, GIS can be performed purely using scripting languages  
  - Python  
  - R  
  - Javascript  
  - Julia

## Software - benefits of open source{.smaller}
+ Available to you, for free, forever (even after Cal Poly)
+ It’s free, as in liberty. If you need extra functionality in QGIS, you can do more than just hope it
will be included in the next release. You can sponsor the development of a feature, or add it
yourself if you are familiar with programming.
+ Compatible with any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux)
+ Collectively advances human knowledge / progress
+ Commonly used in many organizations
+ Easier to learn ArcGIS after QGIS than the other way around

## Beautiful Maps
+ [QGIS Map gallery](https://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis/pool/)
+ [Oceano Dunes (using plas.io)](https://p3d.in/Z86TN) 
+ [Stackexchange thread of beautiful maps](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3083/seeking-examples-of-beautiful-maps)

## Syllabus Review

# GIS Concepts

## Location

## Direction

## Distance


## Space

## Navigation

## Layers

## Attributes


## Map Types
There are a few types of maps:

+ A  
+ B
+ Reference - shows location of an object
+ Thematic - shows how one or more factors are
distributed across space
+ Dynamic / Interactive - maps that change depending on user input

## Map Scale

## What is data? (_What are data?_) 
+ "Related items of (chiefly numerical) information considered collectively, typically obtained by scientific work and used for reference, analysis, or calculation."
+ "Quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, considered collectively. Also (in non-technical contexts): information in digital form."
-OED  

## What is information?
+ “The imparting of knowledge in general.”
+ “Knowledge communicated concerning some particular fact, subject, or event; that of which one is apprised or told; intelligence, news.”  
-OED

## What is Spatial Data?
:::{.fragment}
Data with a geographic and/or  spatial component.
:::

## What is Metadata
:::{.fragment}
Data about the data, e.g. units, date collected, instruments used...
:::

## Data Storage{style="font-size: 0.5em"}
+ Often we store data in computer-readable format in files
  + Sometimes files store data as text (often called human readable files) 
  + Other times there are just 1s and 0s (binary file)
  + Even the human readable files are ultimately stored as 1s and 0s ((want to know more)[https://www.totalphase.com/blog/2023/05/binary-ascii-relationship-differences-embedded-applications/?srsltid=AfmBOooKE_ehcrFst_V6Q5XtDbOnStzYrjjO0zrwIsDwYYa4M40rhBqW])


## Data Storage{style="font-size: 0.5em"}

_File extensions_ denote files readable by certain programs, for example:

| Extension | description       |
|------------------|------------|
| filename.txt     | text file |
| filename.doc     | Microsoft Word file |
| filename.pdf     | portable document file |
| filename.html    | hypertext markup language |
| filename.xml     | extensible markup language |
| filename.tif     | tagged image format |
| filename.json    | javascript object notation |
| filename.geojson | geographic json |
| filename.laz     | LASer zip |
| filename.parquet | compressed table |


## File types 
+ Computer programsonly read certain file formats.
+ Familiarity with different file types is helpful.
+ Common GIS file types: .shp (and .prj, .shx, .dbf, etc), .kml, .tiff, .gpkg,
.json, .geojson, .txt, .hdf, .nc, .parquet and a few others

## File Organization and Computer Hygiene

:::{r-stack}
:::{.fragment  .fade-in-then-out style="position: absolute; 
font-size: 0.5em"}
Be kind to your future self - keep your files organized:

+ Use directories (a.k.a folders)
+ Use descriptive names:
  + e.g. `slo_county_26910.geojson` not `county.geojson`
+ Don't put spaces in file or directory names (see [this](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/mmnpf-cez11))
