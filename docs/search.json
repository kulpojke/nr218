    "text": "Use of AI\nAI generated text may not be used for any writing.\nStudents can seek AI assistance for project work, but it is important to consider that AI will make you stupid and waste your time! + Depending on AI prevents development of critical thinking, writing, and problem-solving skills + AI will sometimes lead you down a terrible, deep rabbit hole of confusion + Getting quick answers without working through problems will leave gaps in foundational knowledge needed for advanced coursework + The struggle of working through difficult concepts is often where the most valuable learning occurs\nThat is not to say LLMs are never useful or appropriate to use, but you need to know their limitations."

How does bike infrastructure/time of day factor in?\nIMPORTANT: Do not choose too challenging a problem or too large a geographic area or time window to analyze - you have 5 weeks to work on this project. It should be well-scoped and achievable.\n\n\n\n\nWhat data will you use to answer the question you’ve posed?\nIs this primary or secondary data?
