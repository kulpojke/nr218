    "text": "As recently as the World War II era, computer was an occupation, defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as one who computes; a calculator, reckoner; specifically a person employed to make calculations in an observatory, in surveying, etc. Modern electronic computers are named after this profession because they have their origins in large-scale mathematical calculations once performed by human computers, In the 1950s the computer was reconstructed to be an electronic data-processing machine rather than a mathematical instrument(Campbell-Kelly et al. 2023).\nWe will skip through decades of punch cards, tape ribbons, cold war military machinations, the developments of Silicon Valley, etc.. leading to the modern computer (see Campbell-Kelly et al. (2023) if you want more detail). There are , however, a couple of important developments that will be of importance going forward.\n\nThe first is the development of the Unix operating system (and C programming language) at Bell Labs during 1969–1974. The use of C made Unix “portable,” so that it could be implemented on any computer system. Up until this point, computers were centralized resources. The clean, minimalist, functional design of Unix made it possible for users to create variants without affecting the inherent reliability of the system. This spawned versions such as the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) in 1978, and later in the 1990s Linux (Campbell-Kelly et al. 2023). Mac OSX is also a Unix Variant (apple2011osx-unix-users?).\nAnother important development occurred in 1980 when IBM contracted Microsoft to create an operation system for their personal computer. At the time Microsoft did not have an actual product, so they bought one and tweaked if to make MS-DOS.\n\nUnix variants and Windows are by far the most common operating systems on general-purpose computers (desktops, laptops, and servers). Figure 1 shows the lineage of common operating systems. GIS applications are almost always run on one of these platforms. By in large computers with OSs derived from UNIX and MS-DOS behave in the same ways, but there are some important differences (for a simple overview of differences see this article). A few of these differences will come up from time to time during this course. The computers in the lab are Windows machines (😐). Many of you are probably using Macs with OSX (🗿). Maybe some of you are Linux users (🔥, 💅).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Family tree of modern general purpose operating systems. With the exception of Windows (which derives from MS-DOS) all widely used modern general purpose OSs are based on UNIX.\n\n\n\nThe definition of a computer that we will use for this class is, a machine that manipulates data following a list of programmed instructions. With this definition in mind, it seems that in order to take advantages of the capabilities of computers one must understand data, and how computers follow programmed instructions."

    "text": "As recently as the World War II era, computer was an occupation, defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as one who computes; a calculator, reckoner; specifically a person employed to make calculations in an observatory, in surveying, etc. Modern electronic computers are named after this profession because they have their origins in large-scale mathematical calculations once performed by human computers, In the 1950s the computer was reconstructed to be an electronic data-processing machine rather than a mathematical instrument(Campbell-Kelly et al. 2023).\nWe will skip through decades of punch cards, tape ribbons, cold war military machinations, the developments of Silicon Valley, etc.. leading to the modern computer (see Campbell-Kelly et al. (2023) if you want more detail). There are , however, a couple of important developments that will be of importance going forward.\n\nThe first is the development of the Unix operating system (and C programming language) at Bell Labs during 1969–1974. The use of C made Unix “portable,” so that it could be implemented on any computer system. Up until this point, computers were centralized resources. The clean, minimalist, functional design of Unix made it possible for users to create variants without affecting the inherent reliability of the system. This spawned versions such as the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) in 1978, and later in the 1990s Linux (Campbell-Kelly et al. 2023). Mac OSX is also a Unix Variant (apple2011osx-unix-users?).\nAnother important development occurred in 1980 when IBM contracted Microsoft to create an operation system for their personal computer. At the time Microsoft did not have an actual product, so they bought one and tweaked if to make MS-DOS.\n\nUnix variants and Windows are by far the most common operating systems on general-purpose computers (desktops, laptops, and servers). Figure 1 shows the lineage of common operating systems. GIS applications are almost always run on one of these platforms. By in large computers with OSs derived from UNIX and MS-DOS behave in the same ways, but there are some important differences (for a simple overview of differences see this article). A few of these differences will come up from time to time during this course. The computers in the lab are Windows machines (😐). Many of you are probably using Macs with OSX (🗿). Maybe some of you are Linux users (🔥, 💅).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Family tree of modern general purpose operating systems. With the exception of Windows (which derives from MS-DOS) all widely used modern general purpose OSs are based on UNIX.\n\n\n\nThe definition of a computer that we will use for this class is, a machine that manipulates data following a list of programmed instructions. With this definition in mind, it seems that in order to take advantages of the capabilities of computers one must understand data, and how computers follow programmed instructions."

    "section": "Paths",
    "text": "Paths\n\n\nA path is a string that uniquely identifies an item in a file system. Generally, a path is composed of directory names, and optionally a filename, all separated by delimiters. Figure 4 shows the path to index.qmd in a terminal. The bottom line of the terminal displays /home/michael/CP/nr218/index.qmd. This is the full path to index.qmd. The delimiters are the character /. If you look back to Figure 1, you see that the root directory is just /. The directory called “home” is directly below / in the hierarchy, thus the full path to home is /home (or /home/). Similarly the full path to the directory “michael” is /home/michael (or /home/michael/) etc… (but, /home/michael/CP/nr218/index.qmd would never be written /home/michael/CP/nr218/index.qmd/ because index.qmd is not a directory, it does not contain other files). In order for an application to use a file, it must know the path to that file.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Top: Linux terminal showing the full path to index.qmd. Bottom the same file shown in the GUI file explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: Cross-Referencing a Tip\n\n\n\nIf you are saying to yourself, “How are 0s and 1s stored in a computer, that makes no sense, numbers are abstractions but computers are physical objects?”, that is reasonable. The ones and zeros are actually stored as sites holding an electrical charge, or not, but that is a deeper explanation than we need for this course."

    "text": "Volatile and Non-Volatile Memory\nData can be stored on a disk (as we have previously alluded to). This type of memory is called on-disk storage. We call on this type of storage non-volatile because when the program using the data is terminated, or the computer is turned off the data persists to be used later. This is in contrast to Random Access Memory (RAM), which is volatile (if the program terminates, the data held there is lost). In RAM the data sits in volatile memory cells addressed by numeric locations; the CPU accesses it directly with very low latency (quickly). All this is managed by the OS via pages and caches. Only in advanced cases does the user take an interest of the details of this process.\nWhen an application is running, it typically stores the data it is actively using in RAM (or if it is large in temporary files on-disk) This allows the application to run more quickly. When the user wants to save changes that are held in these temporary forms of memory they must specify a file to save it to.\nrelative directories\nwhen you are working data in ram or saved as temporary files, need to save to avoid data loss\n\nReferences\n\n\nCampbell-Kelly, Martin, William F Aspray, Jeffrey R Yost, Honghong Tinn, and Gerardo Con Dı́az. 2023.
