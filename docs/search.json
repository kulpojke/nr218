    "title": "Computers",
    "section": "Paths",
    "text": "Paths\n\n\nA path is a string that uniquely identifies an item in a file system. Generally, a path is composed of directory names, and optionally a filename, all separated by delimiters. Figure 4 shows the path to index.qmd in a terminal. The bottom line of the terminal displays /home/michael/CP/nr218/index.qmd. This is the absolute path or full path to index.qmd. The delimiters are the character /. If you look back to Figure 1, you see that the root directory is just /. The directory called “home” is directly below / in the hierarchy, thus the full path to home is /home (or /home/). Similarly the full path to the directory “michael” is /home/michael (or /home/michael/) etc… (but, /home/michael/CP/nr218/index.qmd would never be written /home/michael/CP/nr218/index.qmd/ because index.qmd is not a directory, it does not contain other files).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Top: Linux terminal showing the full path to index.qmd. Bottom the same file shown in the GUI file explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths can also be written relative to the current directory, for example, when QGIS opens a saved project, the project file tells QGIS to load data from other files. It does this by telling it where to find them relative to the project file. For example if a project file project.qgz is stored in /home/michael/CP/nr218/project along with some data in a subdirectory, as shown below, the relative path to some_data.tif would be data/some_data.tif.\nproject\n│\n├── data\n│   └── some_data.tif\n└── project.qgz\nThe advantage of using relative paths emerges when files are organized all within a project directory. If one were to move the entire project directory to another parent directory, the project file still points to the needed files. If files are outside of the project directory, or full paths were used, this would not be the case.\nIn order for an application to use a file, it must know the path to that file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: Data storage\n\n\n\nIf you are saying to yourself, “How are 0s and 1s stored in a computer, that makes no sense, numbers are abstractions but computers are physical objects?”, that is reasonable. The ones and zeros are actually stored as sites holding an electrical charge, or not, but that is a deeper explanation than we need for this course."

    "section": "Volatile and Non-Volatile Memory",
    "text": "Volatile and Non-Volatile Memory\nData can be stored on a disk (as we have previously alluded to). This type of memory is called on-disk storage. We call on this type of storage non-volatile because when the program using the data is terminated, or the computer is turned off the data persists to be used later. This is in contrast to Random Access Memory (RAM), which is volatile (if the program terminates, the data held there is lost). In RAM the data sits in volatile memory cells addressed by numeric locations; the CPU accesses it directly with very low latency (quickly). All this is managed by the OS via pages and caches. Only in advanced cases does the user take an interest of the details of this process.\nWhen an application is running, it typically stores the data it is actively using in RAM (or if it is large in temporary files on-disk) This allows the application to run more quickly. When the user wants to save changes that are held in these temporary forms of memory they must specify a file to save it to. In most GUI based applications this is done via the File menu, or using the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on macOS).\nWhen you are working in QGIS or any other GIS (or most other types of) application, you need to save to avoid data loss. It is a good idea to frequently save your work by pressing Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on macOS).\n\nReferences\n\n\nCampbell-Kelly, Martin, William F Aspray, Jeffrey R Yost, Honghong Tinn, and Gerardo Con Dı́az. 2023.

    "title": "Using computers well enough for GIS",
    "section": "Task 1: Exploring a Directory Structure and unzipping files",
    "text": "Task 1: Exploring a Directory Structure and unzipping files\n\nDownload the toy data here (rigth-click -&gt; Save Link As). By default the downloaded file will be in your Downloads folder. While it is possible to work with data that is in your Download directory, it is a bad habit, and will likely lead to mayhem and frustration. For now, we will do just that, so unzip toy_data.zip right into the download folder (see Tip 1 for how to do this.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: How do I unzip a zip archive? What is a zip archive?\n\n\n\nTo unzip:\n\nWindows (GUI): In File Explorer, find the .zip, right-click → “Extract All…,” choose your desired destination folder, click Extract.\nmacOS (GUI): In Finder, double-click the .zip to expand it, then drag/move the extracted folder into your destination folder.\nLinux (terminal): cd ~/Downloads (or wherever it landed), then run unzip SPR_data.zip -d &lt;destination directory&gt; (replace &lt;destination directory&gt; with your actual destination directory. Install unzip if missing: sudo apt install unzip).\n\nWhat is a zip file? A zip file is a compressed archive. Zipping a folder full of sub-directories and files compresses the data (makes it take up less memory) while preserving the directory structure. When you unzip, or extract the data you get back an uncompressed copy. Zipped files are smaller, so they are good for transferring data, or long term storage when the data is not in use. Do not work directly with files compressed in a zip! .While QGIS and other applications can read files from inside of a zip, it is a bad idea to do so. There are many processing tools that cannot work with the compressed file. Often you will get part of the way through a workflow and try some step of your analysis, only to get an error about unsupported file types.\n\n\n\nCreate a working directory, nr218 for the class in your home folder directory (see Tip 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2: Where is my home folder?\n\n\n\n\nWindows: C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt; (shows as “This PC &gt; Windows (C:) &gt; Users &gt; ` in File Explorer).\nmacOS: /Users/&lt;username&gt;; Finder shows it with a house icon under Go → Home.\nLinux: /home/&lt;username&gt; (or occasionally /Users/&lt;username&gt;); in a terminal it can also be called ~, and file managers usually label it “Home.”\n\n\n\n\nOpen QGIS and start a blank project.\n\n\nPress Ctrl+S. This opens a dialogue for saving the QGIS project. Navigate to the nr218 directory you just created. Name the project after you CalPoly email address (e.g. mthuggin. Note that this would be a terrible thing to actually name a project). You have now saved a file containing the project.\nPress Ctrl+Shift+V, this is the keyboard shortcut to open a vector file (Do not worry if you do not yet know what I mean by vector file). Navigate to ~/Downloads/toy_data/WellNamedFiles and select Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson. You should now see a polygon in in the map (Figure 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: You should se something like this after opening Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson.  It is a polygon showing the Eaton Fire perimeter\n\n\n\n\nClose the project (Project -&gt; Close in drop down menus).\nMove the toy_data folder from your Downloads folder to ~/nr218\nOpen the project you previously saved (Project -&gt; Open Recent in drop down menus)\n\n\nNow QGIS cannot find the Eaton Fire perimeter data because the relative path to the data has changed (see Tip 3). A dialogue such as the one shown in Figure 2 will appear. Don’t worry about trying to fix the problem yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: When the relative path to data changes (or the data is deleted) QGIS cannot find it.`\n\n\n\n\nOpen a shell (macOS/Linux: Terminal; Windows: PowerShell) and navigate into the directory with the files, cd ~/nr218.\nCreate a document in a text editor (e.g. notepad on Windows). Name it gustav_adolf_lab1.txt (use your own name) and save it in ~/nr218.\nView the contents of the directory:\n\n\nIn the terminal (while in ~/nr218) type tree (on Windows tree omits files by default, so use tree /F)\n\nmacOS/Linux, install if missing: brew install tree / sudo apt install tree.\nWindows PowerShell: tree should be present. If you love typing you can use Get-ChildItem -Recurse.\n\nCopy the output and paste at the top of your text document.\nIn your text document answer the following questions.\n\n\nType pwd in the terminal, this shows the path to the present working directory, what is the output (paste it)?\n\n\nBased on the contents of the directory, what do you think are some best practices for naming files?\n\n\nWhy do you think working on files that are in your download folder is a bad idea?\n\n\n\nYou will use tree and pwd throughout the quarter to show me how you are organizing your data. In order to do this you will also need to know how to navigate into your working directory (see Tip 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3: What is a Path?\n\n\n\nA path is a string that uniquely identifies an item in a file system. Generally, a path is composed of directory names, and optionally a filename, all separated by delimiters.\nQGIS, and other applications keep track of where data using relative paths, as opposed to absolute paths. An absolute (or full path) is the path to the file relative to the root directory, for example, on my laptop the directory for this class has an absolute path /home/michael/CP/nr218, where the root directory is just /. The directory called home is directly below / in the hierarchy, thus the full path to home is /home (or /home/, a directory can be written with a trailing slash). Similarly the full path to the directory michael is /home/michael (or /home/michael/, or using its alias ~, see Tip 2).\nA relative path is the position of a file relative to the position of the file that is looking for it. For the QGIS project file in your nr218 directory, the relative path to the Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson was ../Downloads/toy_data/WellNamedFiles/Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson (../ means parent directory or up one level). When you moved it, the relative path changed to WellNamedFiles/Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson (or ./WellNamedFiles/Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson, where . means the present directory). When you re-opened the project after moving the data, QGIS read the project file which told it, “Load the Eaton perimeter file found at ../Downloads/toy_data/WellNamedFiles/Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.geojson.” QGIS looked at that relative location, and the file was missing, so it complained to you with the dialogue box. In order for an application to use a file, it must know the path to that file.\nIn a (bash-like) terminal you can change directories using the cd command to navigate to a directory by giving ita path. You can use and absolute path, e.g. cd  /home/michael/CP/nr218 or equivalently cd ~/CP/nr218. Or you can use a relative path, cd ../ to go to the parent directory, cd ../../ to go up two levels in the directory hierarchy. If you are in /home/michael, cd CP/nr218 would do the same thing as cd  /home/michael/CP/nr218."

    "section": "Warm Up: Finding Data Online",
    "text": "Warm Up: Finding Data Online\nSo far in this class you’ve been given files to work with. Today, we’re going to practice acquiring some data on our own.\nGenerating DEMs, particularly at a high resolution, can be costly and time-consuming. Luckily, there are some great online resources for accessing existing imagery. One such resource is the USGS LiDAR Explorer.\nFollow the link above, and then click “Launch Application” to get to the interactive map (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Startup map of LiDAR Explorer\n\n\n\nYou can navigate around the map by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Zooming is accomplished using your scroll wheel (or the “+” button at the top left of the map viewer, if you like your zooming to be painful). Orient your map view so that it’s centered on San Luis Obispo. There are three check boxes in the left panel. Try checking and unchecking them to see what happens.\nNext, let’s define our area of interest (AOI). This will return all of the available LiDAR and DEM downloads within a specified geographic area. Click the Define area of interest box and draw a box around SLO (by holding control and dragging), then check what pops up on the right side of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Defined area of interest\n\n\n\nOn the right panel, you should see dropdowns for DEM, LiDAR, and DSM/ORI products within the AOI. After we define the AOI, these dropdowns populate with all downloadable files in the area. In this case, we’re interested in what DEMs are available, so let’s expand that dropdown. As you can see, there are a lot of files! Too many! We don’t want to download that much data for this exercise, so let’s choose just one tile to download. First, click on the folder icon next to DEM 1 Meter. You should now see a list of individual files, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Individual DEM tiles\n\n\n\nChoose one of the files on the list and click the download icon next to it. Once downloaded, rename the file to DEM_1_meter.tif and move it to nr218/lab_8/data.\nNext, close the 1 meter file list (click again on the folder icon) and open the 30m folder. Choose one of those files to download, rename it to DEM_30_meter.tif, and save it to data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: What is topobathy Lidar\n\n\n\nTopobathymetric lidar measures land, water, and submerged land simultaneously. Topobathymetric lidar sensors use two independent laser sources. A near infrared laser is used to map the land and surface of the water, while a visible green laser is used to penetrate the water surface and measure the bottom (in water depths of up to about five meters, depending on water clarity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2: Building a Virtual Raster\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to use 1 meter DEMs for a project, but needed to cover a larger area, you could save on file size by downloading all of the individual tiles you needed and ‘stitching’ them together into a virtual raster (VRT) in QGIS. A VRT acts as a catalog for all selected raster files, rather than creating a new image. This can be useful for doing quick actions like reprojecting or clipping a large area of raster imagery, but you will get better overall performance using a merged TIF file."

    "section": "Task 1: Comparing and Visualizing DEMs",
    "text": "Task 1: Comparing and Visualizing DEMs\n\nOpen a new project in QGIS and save it to your nr218/lab_8 folder (NOT within one of the sub-folders).\nSet the global CRS of the project to EPSG:26910 (UTM Zone 10N). You can do this by going to Project &gt; Properties &gt; CRS.\nAdd in a satellite basemap of your choice.\nAdd in your 1 meter DEM file. You have options on how to do this:\n\n\nClick and drag the file into QGIS from your file explorer\nGo to Layer &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Raster Layer (You can also do this by hitting Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + R)\n\n\nAdd in your 30 meter DEM in the same way.\n\n\nComparing DEM Resolutions\nTake a look at the two DEM files. If they’re not both already in EPSG:26910, reproject using Raster &gt; Projections &gt; Warp (Reproject).\n10 and 30 meter DEMs are typically much easier to track down than 1 meter. However, what we gain in accessibility and area coverage, we give up in detail and accuracy. To illustrate this, let’s compare the elevation values between the two DEMs.\nSampling Raster Values\nWe can do this using a tool called Sample Raster Values. First, we’ll need to add some points to our map.\n\nGo to Layer &gt; Create Layer &gt; New Temporary Scratch Layer\nName the layer something useful, change the geometry type to to point, and make sure the CRS is 26910. Hit Ok.\nEditing should be toggled on by default, but if it’s not, click on the pencil icon. Then select add point feature and add ~4 points to the map (click on the map to add a point). Make sure they are on areas of overlap between both DEMs, and try to cover different levels of elevation (lighter/darker gray).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Add Feature Icon\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with your points, hit the save icon (next to the pencil) and toggle editing off.\n\nNow let’s check out the sample raster values tool using our 1 meter DEM.\n\nIn the processing tools window, search for sample raster values.\nSelect our newly created point layer as the input, and our DEM_1_meter as the raster layer.\nIf you’d like, change the output column prefix to something more informative. Then hit Run.\n\nExamine the output of the tool. What did it do? Before we move on, rename the output layer (called Sampled by default) to something more useful.\nNow run the same steps as above, but use the output layer as your input and the 30 meter DEM as your raster. You should now have a new point layer that includes the elevation attributes from both DEMs. Open the attribute table and look at the values - why do you think the values are different? Are there certain areas where they’re closer than other areas? Why might that be?\nTake a screenshot of your final attribute table and add it to your submission doc.\nNow let’s talk about visualizing elevation. By default, the numerical values of each pixel in a DEM are symbolized on a scale of black and white, also known as Singleband gray. In this state it’s pretty difficult to gain any information from the image, so let’s change it to something more useful.\n\n\nHillshade\n\nOpen up the Symbology window for the 1m DEM layer (can elaborate here if needed).\nWhere it says Render Type, click the dropdown and select Hillshade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3: Azimuth and Z Factor\n\n\n\nWe can adjust the output of our hillshade by changing the values of the azimuth and Z factor. Take a moment to play around with the values for these parameters. What do you think each one does?\n\n\nAfter you hit Apply, your DEM should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Hillshade\n\n\n\nTry the same process with your 30 meter DEM. How do the outputs differ?\nTake a screenshot of your hillshade render and add it to your submission doc.\n\n\nContour Lines\n\nGo back to the Symbology window and change the Render Type to Contour. Adjust the Contour Interval and Index Contour Interval until the amount of bands generated feels good to you (i.e. not too cluttered, but enough to actually show the topography). I would also recommend making the Index lines slightly thicker, for visual differentiation.\n\nNow your DEM should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Contour Lines\n\n\n\nWe have another opportunity to compare our DEMs here. Change the symbology of your 30 meter DEM to contour lines, and look at the two layers together. Again, how do the two layers differ? What might be the cause of that?\nTake a screenshot of your contour render and add it to your submission doc."

Luckily, QGIS also has processing tools that we can use to turn our hillshade and contour lines into separate layers that can be shared.\n\nHillshade\n\nFrom the Raster menu, go to Analysis &gt; Hillshade (or search Hillshade in the processing tools window).\nAdjust the Z factor if you’d like. Let’s keep the azimuth at its default for now.\nClick on the 3 dots to the right of the [Save to temporary file] box and select Save to file. Navigate to your data folder and name the file something you can identify it by (i.e. include hillshade in the name). Before you hit Save, make sure the file format is .tif.\nLeave all other parameters at their default and hit Run.\n\n\n\nContour Lines\n\nNow go to Raster &gt; Extraction &gt; Contour (or search Contour in the processing tools window).\nAdjust the contour interval to the same value you used before (for this tool we don’t specify an index interval).\nSave the layer as a new file the same way you did above. Make sure that the file type is .geojson.\nLeave all other parameters at their default and hit Run.\n\n\n\nCombining DEM Visualizations\nYou should have two new layers on your map. We can now combine all of our DEM layers together to create an aesthetically pleasing map.\n\nOpen up the Symbology window for our original DEM and change the Render Type to Singleband pseudocolor. Choose any of the color ramps from the dropdown.\nMake sure your hillshade layer is the second layer in the stack. In the Symbology window, change the blending mode to multiply. Locate the Transparency tab (one below Symbology), and adjust the layer opacity to your liking.\nMake sure your contour layer is the topmost layer. Go to the Symbology window and adjust the color and thickness of your lines to your liking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Layered DEM\n\n\n\nAnother Option: Red Relief\nAlternatively, we can combine our DEM and hillshade layers to create the red relief visualization that we talked about in lecture.\n\nChange the render type of the original DEM back to singleband gray.\nChange the render type of the hillshade layer to singleband pseudocolor.\nUnder the color ramp dropdown, choose Create new color ramp. Set the first color to black, and choose a shade of red for the second.\nGo back to the transparency tab and adjust the opacity to your liking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Red Relief Hillshade\n\n\n\nNice! Something like this can be a great base for displaying other data layers (foreshadowing)."

    "text": "Task 3: Extracting Information from DEMs\nThere are many uses for DEMs beyond elevation, and many tools that we can use to extract additional information from them!\nFor the rest of this exercise, you’ll need to download this zip file(Open the link in a new tab and click “download raw file” button on upper right). Unzip the file and move the newly generated folder to data.\nAdd all of the files in the unzipped folder to your project in QGIS. You can remove the DEM layers used above .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 4: Layer Preparation\n\n\n\nTake a quick look through the layers from the folder. What types of data are we dealing with? Are they all in the same CRS? If not, we should take a moment to reproject.\n\n\n\nSlope and Aspect\nSlope tells us how steep the terrain is (in degrees or percent change from horizontal). Aspect tells us which compass direction each slope of the terrain faces.\nWe can generate layers for slope and aspect similarly to how we created our hillshade and contour layers. For slope, go to Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Slope. Make sure your input layer is spr_DEM, and keep all other parameters at their default. Save the output to a file, like we did above, and hit Run. Do the same for aspect (Raster &gt; Analysis &gt; Aspect).\nExamine the outputs of each analysis tool. What might you use a map of slope for? What about aspect?\nWrite down your thoughts and add screenshots of your slope and aspect layers to your submission doc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 5: Terrain Analysis\n\n\n\nTogether with hillshade and contours, slope and aspect are often categorized as terrain analysis. We can generate other layers of information in a similar way, such as topographic position index (TPI), which classifies each pixel in relation to the altitude of its neighboring cells. Other terrain indices you might encounter include the topographic wetness index (TWI) and topographic ruggedness index (TRI)."

    "text": "Task 4: Putting It All Together\nOh no! Hydrologists at Swanton Pacific Ranch have lost track of all of their rain gauges! Luckily, we have the point layer open in QGIS right now. Since we have it open, they’ve asked for our help identifying one specific rain gauge. The rain gauge they’re looking for is:\n\nOn a slope that’s facing Northwest\nAbove 200 meters of elevation\nOn a relatively flat area (less than 5 degrees of steepness)\n\n\nNote! the pixel values for the Swanton Pacific Ranch DEM are in meters.\n\nUsing the layers that you’ve created, and the tools we’ve practiced with in this lab (OR tools that we’ve used in past labs… hint hint…), identify which rain gauge the team is looking for.\nOnce you have your answer, note which rain gauge the hydrologists are looking for, what the associated values are for slope, aspect, and elevation, and explain how you reached your conclusion on your submission doc.\n\nBonus: Exporting a Map\nGreat! Now that we’ve found the rain gauge, the hydrologists need a way to navigate to it. Let’s make them a couple maps to use as a reference. First, we’ll make a GeoPDF, or a georeferenced PDF.\nExporting a GeoPDF\nRe-run the steps above to generate hillshade and contour layers for the SPR DEM. You can either do this using the Symbology tab, or generate two new layers. Once you have a map image that you’re satisfied with, go to Project &gt; Import/Export &gt; Export Map to PDF.\nIn the popup window, you can leave everything at its default, but make sure to check the box next to Create Geospatial PDF. Hit Save, and then navigate to your lab_8/docs folder and choose an appropriate name for the file.\nLet’s take a look at what we just exported! Locate the file on your computer and open it in Adobe or a similar PDF viewer. Look for a Layers icon, and see what you can do - you should be able to toggle the map layers on and off. Pretty cool!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 6: Using a GeoPDF in the Field\n\n\n\nIf you have the app Avenza on your phone, or something similar, you can import GeoPDFs from QGIS and use them as your base map! In this case, someone could in theory travel to Swanton and use the PDF we just exported to locate the missing rain gauge.\n\n\nExporting a Print Layout\nIt’s good practice for us to also export the map as a flattened PDF.\n\nCreate a new map layout by clicking the New Print Layout icon or hitting Ctrl/Cmd + P. Name it something useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 7: Using Guidelines for Easier Map Making\n\n\n\nWhen setting up a map layout, we can make our lives easier by putting down guide lines for map items to automatically snap to. Let’s try it now - select the Guides tab on the right panel and add some horizontal and vertical lines. You can click on the side rulers, or manually type in the values that you’d like your lines to appear at.\n\n\n\nNow add a new map to the layout (Add Item &gt; Add Map or click the Add Map Icon on the left side panel). Adjust the map to your liking by selecting Move Item Contents or hitting the C key. You can also manually set the scale of the map in the Item Properties window. Do that now, and change it to a round number large enough to view the entire extent of the layers.\nNext we’ll add a legend. Once you’ve created one, go to the Item Properties tab on the right and do some clean-up. Remember we can adjust which layers are included in our legend by un-checking Auto-update, and then removing unwanted entries. We can also rename the entries we are keeping by double clicking on their names.\nNext let’s add a scale bar. Play around with the number and width of each segments - you want to end up with a value that will be informative to your viewers. Place a second scale bar next to the first, and change the Style to Numeric. What does this number mean? Think back to step 1 - why is it helpful to set the scale to be a round number?\nLastly, add a map title.\nClick the Export as PDF icon, or go to Layout &gt; Export as PDF.\nSave your pdf in your lab_8/docs folder, and name it something useful.\nIn this case, you can leave all of the parameters as-is and just hit save.\n\nUse tree to show the directory structure for the project so far. Include it in your submission doc.\nUpload your final map in addition to your submission doc."
