# DEMs

## What is a DEM?

+ A __Digital Elevation Model__
+ Representation of the topographic surface of the Earth
+ DTM (Digital Terrain Model) is usually synonymous with DEM (though sometimes DEM is used to encompass DTM and DSM)
+ A DSM (Digital Surface Model) includes vegetation and structures

A DHM (often referred to as DEM) shows the land surface without vegetation or buildings. A Canopy Height Model (CHM) shows vegetation height above ground."}

## How are DEMs made? {style="font-size:0.7em"}

+ Aerial LiDAR imagery
+ Topographic/contour data
+ Satellite imagery/Radar
    + Examples:
        + [ASTER](https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp) (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer)
            + Photogrammetry from images 
            + 30 m resolution
        + [IceSAT](https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/dem.php) (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite)
            + Lidar 
            + $\le$ 500 m resolution
        + [SRTM](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-shuttle-radar-topography-mission-srtm-1) (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission)
            + SAR
            + DSM
            + 1 arcsecond resolution


## Pseudoquiz!

What does 1 arcsecond resolution mean?

## Sidebar: What is LiDAR? {.smaller}

+ Light Detection and Ranging
+ Remote sensing using lasers!
+ Light pulses are fired rapidly from airborne source and then reflected off of the earth's surface
    + The time it takes for the light to return to the source is used to measure the distance to the surface
        + Distance is converted to elevation
+ In addition to DEMs, LiDAR data can be used to generate canopy cover and canopy height indices (among other things!)

## What can DEMs be used for? {.smaller}

+ Terrain analysis
    + Slope, aspect, hillshade, contours
+ Hydrologic modeling
    + Flow direction, flow accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network extraction
+ Environmental risk assessments and hazard modeling
    + Modeling land movement (landslides, erosion)
+ Infrastructure and land use planning
