# NR 218 Project 3: Raster Data Analysis

## Learning Goals: 
1. Become familiar with raster data analysis and GIS concepts such as 
    a. Statistics and measures of central tendency 
    b. Clipping rasters to vectors and Zonal statistics
    b. Working with remote sensing datasets, deriving geophysical properties
    b. Dealing with NoData values and masks 

2 .Chain together commands in order to achieve desired outcomes
3. Work with messy data to produce viable analysis to real world problems

## Provide written responses to the following Questions [4 pts]

1. What are the differences between vector and raster data? 
2. Give 3 examples of real-world data that are best described by (A) Vector datasets, and (B) Raster datasets. Explain your reasoning
3. What is the importance of pixel size and spatial resolution in raster data? 
4. What are some common types of raster data used in GIS? Hint: we have worked with many of them in the class so far. 

## Project Work [6 pts]

For the next questions, you will need to download the SPR Elevation Data, available in the Week 4 folder in canvas, and here, and use it with existing SPR Vector Data, available in the Week 1 folder in canvas, and here, in order to answer the following questions: 

1. Report the minimum, maximum, mean, and median elevation within the boundary of Swanton Ranch, as defined in sprBoundary.geojson? 

2. What are the exact elevations of the highest and lowest Flumes in Swanton Ranch, as described in sprFlumes.geojson? 

3. Report the mean slope (in degrees) for parcels (as defined in sprParcels.geojson) with the following APN #s: `057-131-60`, `057-141-01`, and `057-121-14`.
