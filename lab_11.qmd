# Segmentation (A trivially simple example)

## Data 

+ For the Example:
    + [october_ndvi.tif](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/IQANkl10H8PKRZMAutAFvJ9dAdD9MB2PXMoxdfCf8tiJBtQ?e=MRLhog)

+ Also bag these files for the challenge:

    + [Sentinel-2 median composite image, near Susques Argentina, 2025-04-01 to 2025-10-26](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/IQAJAFt9XMSYRKXWQJmE5hHHAUl5KfJND29B6mnwxG9aO1k?e=C1w895)

    + [Sentinel-2 max composite image, near Susques Argentina, 2025-04-01 to 2025-10-26](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/IQBB5gbdk0DfRosehfzXZXnIAbq2w9jLq_ez7EUw_YIxeWY?e=GJAq1d)


## A simple example of segmentation 

Start a QGIS project ad set the project crs 20 EPSG:6339.

1. Open `october_ndvi.tif`.
2. __What should you do before starting? __
3. Use the raster calculator to create a binary raster where  NDVI > 0.2.
4. Use `Raster` > `Conversion` > `Polygonize` to make polygons from the raster
5. Use the field calculator to calculate area (expression: `$area`)
6. __What units is area in?__
6. Remove tiny polygons based on area.
7. What did you do?

## Challenge! 

You know about spectral indices (There's an index for that!).  You know about (very basic) segmentation. You know about zonal statistics.

1. Segment the lithium brine evaporation ponds using [Sentinel-2 median composite image](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/EQkAW31cxJhEpdZAmYTmEccBIM9mwHiynmSJ85_kavB7hQ?e=Fapfce) and/or [Sentinel-2 maximum composite image](https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mthuggin_calpoly_edu/EUHmBt2TQN9Gix6F_NdlecgBtG4fUFYu99TS0ie4s0dU4w?e=BL3Zcx) (near Susques Argentina, 2025-04-01 to 2025-10-26).
2. Calculate their total area.
3. What is the difference in mean SWIR1 (band 11) within and outside of evaporation ponds in the image?
4. What is a median composite image? A maximum composite image?
