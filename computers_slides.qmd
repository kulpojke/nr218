+ "Related items of (chiefly numerical) information considered collectively, typically obtained by scientific work and used for reference, analysis, or calculation."
+ "Quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, considered collectively. Also (in non-technical contexts): information in digital form."

+ Data is stored on a computer as zeros and ones .  
+ Data is stored at some physical location on the disk, and a pointer is saved which is later used to find the file.
+ The details of this are managed for you by applications or programming languages by representing this relationship as a path.

## Terminals and Shells 

If you have a deep emotional connection to MS Windows, prepare to be offended!

## Terminals Across Operating Systems {style="font-size:0.7em"}

- **Linux**: terminals are native; `/bin/bash`, `/bin/zsh`, or others under the same POSIX conventions.
- **macOS**: ships with Terminal.app and zsh by default; still Unix-like, so scripts often mirror Linux.
- **Windows**: historically lacked a POSIX shell; now offers multiple terminal hosts (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Windows Terminal) with differing command languages.

## The Windows Terminal Zoo {style="font-size:0.7em"}

- **Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`)**: legacy DOS-style environment with limited scripting features.
- **PowerShell (5.x)** vs **PowerShell 7+**: different .NET runtimes, different module compatibility.
- **Git Bash / MSYS2**: provides a GNU userland inside Windows; paths need translation.
- **Environment-specific shells**: `Anaconda Prompt`, `OSGeo4W Shell`, etc., inject toolchains and custom env vars; each behaves slightly differently.

## Why Does `cmd.exe` Feel Janky? {style="font-size:0.7em"}

- Command language rooted in DOS; minimal quoting, no pipelines beyond simple `|`.
- Lacks native concepts like environment exports.
- Encoding quirks (Code Page 437 vs UTF-8) cause unexpected character issues.
- File globbing and path separators differ (`\` vs `/`), breaking cross-platform scripts.

## PowerShell vs Bash {style="font-size:0.7em"}

- PowerShell is object-oriented: pipelines pass .NET objects, not plain strings.
- Bash pipelines stream text; tools like `cat`, `grep`, `awk` compose seamlessly.
- Example (Bash):

```bash
cat access.log | grep "GET /api" | wc -l
```

- PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
Get-Content access.log | Select-String "GET /api" | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count
```
